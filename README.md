# Bookie
A telegram bot to manage a local book club.

### PRE-REQUIREMENTS:
- Make sure you have a Telegram bot created with BotFather. Otherwise you won't have an API key.
## Quick install after cloning repo


```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install the dependencies and setup a virtual env. To run simply do
